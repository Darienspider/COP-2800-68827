## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Goal:

The goal of this project is to Write a program that prompts the user to enter a letter and check whether the letter is a vowel or consonant. Here is a sample run:

- Enter a letter: `B`
Return:  `B` is a `Consonant` 

- Enter a letter: `a`
Return:  `a` is a `Vowel` 

- Enter a letter: `#`
Return:  `#` is not a `Valid Input`
